# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

Vihaan and Rajavi worked on this project through zoomâ€™s screen sharing and remote-control functionality. While Vihaan made the circuits, Rajavi gave the conceptual directions. Both collaboratively worked together to design and debug their solutions for all three questions.


This project was made possible due to the zoom screen sharing and remote control functionality. Thank you to all the TAs who helped us in the OH (Justin Yokota,...)
